# McAfee SCOM Management Pack
McAfee SCOM Management Pack

This management pack discovers and monitors McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator, Agent Handler, McAfee Agent, McShield, EndPoint Protection, Thread Prevention and McAfee Move Agentless.

No Run As Account configuration required.

Note! This SCOM Management Pack has been created quite some years ago when I just started developing. Please use it as you like and improve it where you can. It would be nice for the community if you share your improvements here on Github.

It is provided "as is" without any official support.
